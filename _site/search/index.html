It’s mobile first, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.It’s pretty minimal, but leverages large type and drastic contrast to make a statement, on all devices.      Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

				"content": ""There is a significant amount of subtle, yet precisely calibrated, styling to ensurethat your content is emphasized while still looking aesthetically pleasing.All links are easy to locate and discern, yet don’t detract from the harmonyof a paragraph. The same goes for italics and bold elements. Even the the strikeoutworks if for some reason you need to update your post. For consistency’s sake,The same goes for insertions, of course.Code, with syntax highlightingHere’s an example of some ruby code with line anchors.# The most awesome of classesclass Awesome &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  include EvenMoreAwesome  validates_presence_of :something  validates :email, email_format: true  def initialize(email, name = nil)    self.email = email    self.name = name    self.favorite_number = 12    puts 'created awesomeness'  end  def email_format    email =~ /\\S+@\\S+\\.\\S+/  endendHere’s some CSS:.foobar {  /* Named colors rule */  color: tomato;}Here’s some JavaScript:var isPresent = require('is-present')module.exports = function doStuff(things) {  if (isPresent(things)) {    doOtherStuff(things)  }}Here’s some HTML:&lt;div class=\"m0 p0 bg-blue white\"&gt;  &lt;h3 class=\"h1\"&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Headings!They’re responsive, and well-proportioned (in padding, line-height, margin, and font-size).They also heavily rely on the awesome utility, BASSCSS.They draw the perfect amount of attentionThis allows your content to have the proper informational and contextual hierarchy. Yay.There are lists, too  Apples  Oranges  Potatoes  Milk  Mow the lawn  Feed the dog  DanceImages look great, tooThere are also pretty colorsAlso the result of BASSCSS, you can highlight certain componentsof a post with CSS classes.I don’t recommend using blue, though. It looks like a link.Footnotes!Markdown footnotes are supported, and they look great! Simply put e.g. [^1] where you want the footnote to appear,1 and then addthe reference at the end of your markdown.Stylish blockquotes includedYou can use the markdown quote syntax, &gt; for simple quotes.  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse quis porta mauris.However, you need to inject html if you’d like a citation footer. I will be working on a way tohopefully sidestep this inconvenience.      Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.    Antoine de Saint-ExupéryThere’s more being added all the timeCheckout the Github repository to request,or add, features.Happy writing.            Important information that may distract from the main text can go in footnotes. &#8617;      "",
